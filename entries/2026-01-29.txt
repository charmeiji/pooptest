Daily Entry Template
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Write your daily entry here.
This is a template file - copy it and rename it to match the date format (e.g., 2026-01-25.txt).

You can write multiple lines.
The calendar will automatically convert newlines to line breaks.

Keep it personal and reflective.
Short lines work best for the display format.
